Scripts which may be useful to plex users

find_non_h264.pl simply lists all media files in a directory which are not h264.  This is old and find_codecs.pl is better.

find_codecs.pl    You can use this script to generate a list of your media files and which video codec they use.
If you run the script with no options it will search the current directory.  Or you can provide a path to search like this:  find_codecs.pl PATH

Output file will be generated in /tmp and be readable by text editor, excel, libre calc, etc.  Simple csv!
